# Dataset Loading Fix for Streamlit Cloud Deployment

## Problem
The Streamlit app was failing on Streamlit Cloud with the error "failed to load dataset" because:
- The dataset file (`employee_salary_dataset.csv`) was generated locally but not included in the GitHub repository
- The `.gitignore` file excluded all CSV files in the `data/raw/` directory
- When deployed to Streamlit Cloud, the dataset file didn't exist in the cloud environment

## Solution
Implemented automatic dataset generation with the following components:

### 1. Updated Streamlit App (`webapp/app.py`)
- Added `generate_dataset_if_missing()` function that checks for dataset existence
- Added `generate_employee_dataset_inline()` function for simplified dataset generation
- Modified `load_dataset()` to automatically generate dataset if missing
- Uses Streamlit's built-in progress indicators during generation

### 2. Standalone Dataset Script (`ensure_dataset.py`)
- Created independent script to ensure dataset exists
- Generates simplified 5,000-record dataset with realistic salary calculations
- Can be run before app startup or during deployment
- Provides clear feedback on dataset status

### 3. Updated Deployment Scripts
- Modified `setup.sh` to run `ensure_dataset.py` during deployment
- Updated `start.py` to check dataset before launching Streamlit app
- Ensures dataset is available in cloud environment

### 4. Robust Path Handling
- Multiple fallback paths for dataset location
- Works in different directory structures (local, deployed, development)
- Graceful error handling with user feedback

## How It Works

1. **First-time deployment**: Dataset doesn't exist
   - App detects missing dataset
   - Shows "Generating new dataset..." message
   - Creates realistic 5,000-employee dataset
   - Saves to `data/raw/employee_salary_dataset.csv`
   - App continues normally

2. **Subsequent runs**: Dataset exists
   - App loads existing dataset immediately
   - No generation overhead

3. **Local development**: 
   - Uses existing full dataset if available
   - Falls back to generation if missing

## Dataset Specifications
The auto-generated dataset includes:
- **5,000 employee records** (optimized for cloud performance)
- **11 features**: employee_id, age, gender, education_level, years_experience, city, city_tier, department, company_size, performance_rating, annual_salary
- **Realistic salary calculations** based on:
  - Education level (High School to PhD)
  - Years of experience
  - Department (Technology, Finance, etc.)
  - City tier (Tier 1, 2, 3)
  - Performance rating
  - Random variation and outliers

## Benefits
- ✅ **Zero-config deployment**: Works immediately on Streamlit Cloud
- ✅ **Fast loading**: Lightweight 5K dataset vs 10K original
- ✅ **Realistic data**: Maintains business logic and correlations
- ✅ **Robust**: Multiple fallback mechanisms
- ✅ **User-friendly**: Clear progress indicators and error messages
- ✅ **Development-friendly**: Works in any environment

## Deployment Status
- **Repository**: https://github.com/QizarBilal/Salary-Prediction-AIML
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Ready for deployment
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Dataset loading issue resolved

The app will now work correctly on Streamlit Cloud without requiring manual dataset upload or configuration.
