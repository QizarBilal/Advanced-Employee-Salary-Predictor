# Employee Salary Prediction System - Copilot Instructions

This is a comprehensive Machine Learning project for predicting employee salaries. When working on this project, please follow these guidelines:

## Project Context
- This is an AIML internship project demonstrating professional data science workflow
- Focus on creating production-quality, well-documented code
- Use modern Python data science best practices
- Ensure all code is suitable for portfolio presentation

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Include comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Write modular, reusable code with proper error handling
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Data Science Workflow
- Implement complete ML pipeline: data collection → preprocessing → EDA → modeling → evaluation → deployment
- Use pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for ML, and matplotlib/seaborn/plotly for visualization
- Include proper train-test-validation splits and cross-validation
- Implement multiple ML algorithms and compare performance
- Use feature engineering and selection techniques

## Project Structure
- Keep notebooks organized and well-documented with markdown explanations
- Separate utility functions into src/ modules for reusability
- Save trained models and artifacts in models/ directory
- Create professional Streamlit web application in webapp/
- Maintain clean data organization in data/ folders

## Key Requirements
- Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies professionally
- Create comprehensive EDA with statistical insights and visualizations
- Implement multiple ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Include model interpretability using SHAP or similar tools
- Build an attractive, user-friendly web interface with Streamlit
- Ensure salary predictions are in Indian Rupees (INR)

## Quality Standards
- Write production-ready code with proper exception handling
- Include unit tests where appropriate
- Optimize for performance and memory efficiency
- Ensure reproducibility with random seeds
- Create comprehensive documentation and comments

## Visualization Guidelines
- Create professional, publication-quality plots
- Use consistent color schemes and styling
- Include proper titles, labels, and legends
- Make interactive visualizations where beneficial
- Export high-resolution plots for presentations
